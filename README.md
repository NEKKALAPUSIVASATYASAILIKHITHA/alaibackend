📦 requests==2.31.0
Use:
The requests library is used to send HTTP requests (like GET, POST, etc.) to websites or APIs.
Think of it like your browser making a request to open a webpage — but you're doing it via Python.

✅ What it’s good for:
Getting the HTML content of webpages (requests.get())

Sending login data or JSON to APIs (requests.post())

Handling headers, query parameters, and more

🔍 Example:
python
Copy
Edit
import requests

response = requests.get("https://example.com")
print(response.text)  # prints the HTML content of the page
🍜 beautifulsoup4==4.12.0
Use:
BeautifulSoup is a parser that lets you extract specific data from HTML or XML documents.
It helps you navigate messy HTML and grab just the parts you care about — like headlines, links, etc.

✅ What it’s good for:
Finding elements using tags or classes

Extracting text from HTML

Cleaning up raw HTML before further use

🔍 Example:
python
Copy
Edit
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

html = "<h1>Hello World</h1><p>This is a paragraph.</p>"
soup = BeautifulSoup(html, "html.parser")

print(soup.h1.text)  # Output: Hello World
🧠 How They Work Together:
When you’re scraping websites:

✅ requests fetches the HTML page from the internet.

✅ beautifulsoup4 parses that HTML and helps you extract useful data.

🧪 Combined Example:
python
Copy
Edit
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = "https://example.com"
response = requests.get(url)

soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
title = soup.title.text

print("Page title:", title)
